Most lists you create will be dynamic,
meaning youâ€™ll build a list and then add and remove elements from it as your program runs its course.
For example, you might create a game in which a player has to shoot aliens out of the sky.
You could store the initial set of aliens in a list and then remove an alien from the list each time one is shot down.
Each time a new alien appears on the screen, you add it to the list. 
Your list of aliens will increase and decrease in length throughout the course of the game.
